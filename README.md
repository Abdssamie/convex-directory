# ConvexZen

A production-grade SaaS starter built for minimal budget. Zero vendor lock-in, free tiers where possible, paid upgrades only when you bill customers.

## Why This Stack?

Most SaaS starters cost $50+/month before you make a single dollar. This one is designed to run $0 until you're ready to charge:

| Service       | This Stack  | Alternatives       | Why It Wins                                       |
| :------------ | :---------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hosting**   | Cloudflare  | Vercel, Netlify    | Unlimited bandwidth and global edge performance.  |
| **Database**  | Convex      | Supabase, Firebase | End-to-end TypeScript safety with real-time sync. |
| **Email**        | Brevo       | Resend, SendGrid   | Highest free daily sending limit (300/day).       |
| **Localization** | Intlayer    | i18next, next-intl | Type-safe, natively framework-agnostic.           |
| **Payments**     | Polar       | Stripe             | Acts as Merchant of Record; handles global taxes. |

**Total cost to launch: $0** (all free tiers are generous enough for an MVP)

## Stack

- **Convex** – Realtime backend with database, auth, functions, scheduled jobs. Free tier: 1M row writes/month
- **TanStack Start** – Full-stack React with SSR and streaming
- **Cloudflare Workers** – Edge deployment via Wrangler. Free: 100k requests/day on Workers
- **Better Auth** – Open-source auth that works with Convex. No vendor lock-in
- **Polar** – Developer-friendly payments. 0% until $1k, then 5%
- **Brevo** – Email marketing. Free: 300 emails/day
- **Convalytics** – Privacy-first web + product analytics

## Deployment Model

This boilerplate uses one deploy path:

- **GitHub Actions** deploys both **Convex** and **Cloudflare Workers**
- **Wrangler** deploys the web app
- **Convex CLI** deploys the backend
- **Cloudflare dashboard Git builds should stay disabled**

This avoids frontend/backend drift and keeps deploy behavior predictable across new projects.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pnpm install

# Setup Convex (creates project, generates keys)
pnpm run dev:setup

# Copy env examples
cp packages/backend/.env.local.example apps/web/.env.local
cp packages/backend/.env.convex.example packages/backend/.env.convex
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local

# Dev
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Deployment

```bash
# Sync generated deploy config from project.config.json
pnpm run sync:project-config

# Validate deploy prerequisites
pnpm run doctor:deploy

# Deploy Convex + Cloudflare
pnpm run deploy

# Clean up
pnpm run destroy
```

## New Project Checklist

When turning this boilerplate into a new app, update **one file first**:

- [project.config.json](/home/abdssamie/Projects/convex-zen/project.config.json:1)

Change:

- `projectName`
- `workerName`
- `productionUrl`
- Cloudflare compatibility settings if needed

Then run:

```bash
pnpm run sync:project-config
```

That regenerates:

- [apps/web/wrangler.jsonc](/home/abdssamie/Projects/convex-zen/apps/web/wrangler.jsonc:1)

## Required GitHub Secrets

GitHub Actions expects these repository secrets:

- `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `SITE_URL`
- `VITE_CONVEX_URL`
- `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL`

## Required Convex Production Env

These must be set in the **Convex dashboard** for production auth to work:

- `SITE_URL`
- `AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`

For this repository, both should point at the production Workers URL.

## Deploy Doctor

Run:

```bash
pnpm run doctor:deploy
```

It checks:

- required CI env vars exist
- `SITE_URL` matches `project.config.json`
- `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` is synced with `project.config.json`
- frontend Convex URLs are present for the build

## Boilerplate Rules

- Keep **GitHub Actions** as the only production deploy path
- Keep **Cloudflare Git auto-builds disabled**
- Keep project-specific deploy naming in `project.config.json`
- Regenerate `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` after changing project config
- Manage Convex auth origins separately from Cloudflare Worker vars
